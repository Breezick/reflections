When do you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I create a remote repository when I want to share my experience and collaborate with fellow programmers. 
Why might you want to pull changes manually rather than allowing Git to stay up to date with your remote repository?
Doing it manually enables you to pull exactly what you want, if it is done automatically it may pull some unnecessary details
which where produced for experimental purpose and you do not want to pull.
